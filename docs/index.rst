Bittensor Documentation
========================
Welcome to the official documentation of `Bittensor <https://github.com/opentensor/bittensor>`__, the peer-to-peer machine intelligence framework. 

The dominant tools used to guide machine intelligence are typically benchmarks
which rank systems on a set of predefined tasks. However, the narrow low 
resolution definition of intelligence provided by these benchmarks make them inefficient
guides for the field. Bittensor is an expanded framework that measures knowledge production from 
within a network of intelligence systems.
