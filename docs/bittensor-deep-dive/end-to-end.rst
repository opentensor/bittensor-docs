gRPC Protocol
===============
The BitTensor `gRPC <https://grpc.io/>`_ protocol definition can be 
found `here <https://github.com/opentensor/bittensor/blob/master/bittensor/bittensor.proto>`__. The following define
the communications protocol and message types that travel between nodes/instances of Bittensor.

1. :code:`Bittensor` service.
    - Service definition for tensor processing servers.
    - RPC Methods:

                                                | to be other peers.
